# Supply Chain Risk Management Packs

### Duty of Trustworthiness

> *A compromised vendor is a supply chain break — same impact as a factory going dark. We don't just vet a vendor's price; we vet their security pedigree.*

## The Problem

In 2026, your organization is only as secure as the weakest vendor you hired. C-SCRM is no longer optional for federal contractors. Regulators and insurers are demanding evidence that you govern the ecosystem, not just your own perimeter.

A self-attestation is not evidence. A vendor questionnaire filled out once is not governance. If you cannot trace your digital supply chain to Tier 2 and Tier 3, you do not have visibility — you have hope.

## Pack Index

| # | Pack | What It Governs | Status |
|---|------|----------------|--------|
| 01 | Vendor Risk Assessment Framework | Intake, classification, risk scoring, and approval workflow for all third-party vendors | Planned |
| 02 | Third-Party Attestation Validation | Validating SOC 2, ISO 27001, and penetration test reports — not accepting them at face value | Planned |
| 03 | Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) | Component-level inventory of software supply chain — know what's in your stack | Planned |
| 04 | Vendor Security Scorecard | Continuous monitoring of vendor security posture — not a point-in-time snapshot | Planned |
| 05 | Supply Chain Incident Response | When a vendor is breached, what happens in your house? Playbooks for third-party incidents | Planned |
| 06 | Tier 2/3 Supplier Traceability | Mapping the vendors behind your vendors — where the uncomfortable truths live | Planned |
| 07 | SLA Governance & Monitoring | Contractual security obligations tracked, measured, and enforced with evidence | Planned |
| 08 | Vendor Offboarding & Access Revocation | When a vendor relationship ends, every credential, every connection, every access path is severed and verified | Planned |

## Every Pack Follows the Law of Evidence

We document what *should* be true, we prove what *is* true, and we expose the gap.

We do not accept a vendor's self-attestation as truth. We demand evidence. To trust without verification is to be negligent.
